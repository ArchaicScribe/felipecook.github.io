### Hi, my name is Felipe. I build applications that help like-minded people connect to each other. Iâ€™m doing this partnership with CNM Ingenuity and coding it with the Java language. Are you looking for a connection?

### I want to be an employee at a tech company in Albuquerque.

* Passion Project

    My passion project was when I was teaching students about computer science and also the basics in coding. I engaged the students in a whole-group discussion on why computer science is necessary for the future. Afterwards, students used code.com, and google code to learn the basics of logic problems including the use of  for, if, do, while, and boolean statements. At the end of the project my students were able to present on their project which included a creative sketch using Scratch.

* Qualitative Accomplishments

	+ I am a strong planner. (This can lead to me not being flexible in my options.)
	+ I have grit. (This can lead to me not ending something when perhaps it should have ended.)
	+ I am an analytical thinker. (This can lead me to not think outside the box.)
